    "sourmash represents a deep collaboration with Luiz Irber, a CS PhD student here at UC Davis. Thank you, Luiz! (You should [follow him on Twitter!](https://twitter.com/luizirber/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Many, many other people have contributed to sourmash. In addition to [the official code authors](https://github.com/dib-lab/sourmash/issues/622), I want to highlight the following:\n",
    "* Taylor Reiter has been one of the main \"expert users\" of sourmash, and has driven many of the use cases.\n",
    "* Phillip Brooks greatly informed the early benchmarking and development of sourmash.\n",
    "* Olga Botvinnik and her colleagues at CZ Bio Hub have started to contribute significant new code and use cases to sourmash in the last two years.\n",
    "* Tessa Pierce and Harriet Alexander have contributed many great ideas.\n",
    "* Laurent Gautier was one of the first outside developers of sourmash and his enthusiasm was inspiring.\n",
    "* Adrian Viehweger periodically drops by and asks innocuous questions that frequently lead to us discovering bugs ;)\n",
    "* David Koslicki keeps us on our toes mathematically, as well as serving on Luiz's thesis committee!\n",
    "\n",
    "The Moore Foundation funded the majority of work on sourmash as part of the Data Driven Discovery Initiative via grant GBMF4551 to me. Thanks especially to Chris Mentzel and Carly Strasser for their support over the last 10 years!"
