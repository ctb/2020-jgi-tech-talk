# akker-reads.abundtrim.gz is a collection of reads from podar data
# that maps to the Akkermansia muciniphila ATCC BAA-835 genome via bwa aln.
# "Real" data, with known answer.  There does not appear to be significant
# overlap with other genomes in the Podar data set; so, no significant strain
# variation.

# twofoo targets, below, use a synthetic mixture of reads from podar data -
# the shew-reads.abundtrim.gz (mapping to Shewanella baltica OS223) and
# akker-reads.abundtrim.gz (mapping to Akkermansia muciniphila ATCC BAA-835).
# Many of the shew-reads also map to S. baltica OS185, while the akker-reads
# do not; so this is a good mixture for testing the effects of strain variation
# on catlas foo.

# make synthetic mix data set 'twofoo'
